                <p>It's one of our big goals, so it deserves to be front and center. Keep an eye on progress towards our end-of-year membership goal as it happens.</p>

                <p><strong>We're pretty popular on the internet.</strong> Keep tabs on how many likes and followers we have, and see the latest @dosomething mentions as they come in via the ticker at the bottom of the screen.</p>

                <p>It can be a pain to remember the URLs to all the different services we use. <strong>Dashboard acts as your digital chauffeur by giving you easy shortcuts.</strong> Visit <span class="url">do/</span> in your browser for a list of services, or just add a keyword to the URL to jump directly to the associated service (for example, <span class="url">do/bugs</span>.)</p>

                <p><strong>Introducing DS Play, the office DJ.</strong> We listen to music all the time in the office, but it can be a hassle to do so together. Now everyone can share their favorite songs and tune in live to what the rest of the office is listening to.</p>

                <h2>Technical Notes (for the curious):</h2>
                
                <p>Dashboard was built using a lot of really cool technology. The server runs <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, with help from the <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express.js</a> webapp framework for routing and session handling. <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> provides whizz-bang cross-browser WebSockets magic to broadcast real-time updates from the server. Most data is collected by polling various REST APIs, and cached on the server. Cached data is sent directly to individual clients when they connect, and changes are broadcast to all connected clients when they occur.</p>
                <p>Member statistics are calculated every 10 minutes by doing some estimates. It's not perfect, but it's pretty darn accurate and significantly more feasible to automate. We take the total number of email subscriptions from the fabulous <a href="http://apidocs.mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp API</a>, and add that to the number of subscribers on Mobile Commons (cut down to 75% to account for duplicate accounts). We also add in 120,000 users from the Bully campaign.</p>
                <p>Weather is provided by the (magical) <a href="https://developer.darkskyapp.com/">Dark Sky API</a>, which gives short-term forecasts with precise details for precipitation over the next hour.</p>
                <p>Conference room availability is provided by the <a href="https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/">Google Calendar v3 API</a>. Free/busy information is parsed server-side to find any contiguous events before sending data off to clients.</p>
                <p>Commit status is provided by the <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/">Github API</a>. Code deploys are tracked by pinging the Dashboard server with a POST request when Chris's deploy script is run. Sprint status is obtained using the <a href="#">Redmine REST API</a>.</p>
                <p>Inspired by <a href="http://www.github.com/play/play">Github Play</a>, DS Play is  a custom-built playlist manager and API written in NodeJS, which handles queueing songs & communicating with a desktop Rdio client via <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html">AppleScript</a>. The audio from the desktop Rdio client is streamed across the office using <a href="http://rogueamoeba.com/nicecast/">Nicecast</a>. Because all interaction with the DS Play server occur through a standard REST API, clients could be built for other platforms and devices in the future with minimal changes to the server. The code for DS Play will be open-sourced on Github so that other companies can use and improve it.</p>
                <p>The Twitter ticker is powered by the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis">Twitter Streaming API</a>, with a filter set to subscribe to @dosomething mentions. This allows Dashboard to receive instant updates without the overhead of constantly querying yet another REST API.</p>
                <p>Social icons are from the wonderful <a href="http://symbolset.com/">Symbolset</a> by Oak Studios. Superhero icons used for the conference rooms are from their respective source material. Most other icons were created specifically for Dashboard, and will be released as part of a larger set sometime in the future.</p>
